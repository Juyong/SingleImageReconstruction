## Introduction

This repository contains the test images and the reconstruction results reported in paper:[3D Face Reconstruction with Geometry Details from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05619). It includes three folders, and each folder contains the test images, the reconstructed 3D face models and mtl files. If you have comments or questions, please contact Luo Jiang (jluo@mail.ustc.edu.cn) and Juyong Zhang (juyong@ustc.edu.cn).
